A comprehensive methodological framework designed to help PhD researchers, postdoctoral scientists, and senior practitioners navigate paper typology, novelty gradients, and hybrid contributions in Computer Science.

## 📌 Overview

Many academic papers in computer science are rejected not because the underlying idea is weak, but due to a misalignment between the paper type, the model type, and the validation approach. 

This repository hosts the **Extended Framework for Paper Typology**, which addresses:
1. **Contribution Novelty Gradients:** How the *degree* of novelty (Conceptual, Technical, Empirical, Application) dictates the validation obligation of a paper.
2. **Hybrid Contributions:** How to identify, unpack, and successfully publish papers that span multiple canonical types (e.g., System + Methodology, Empirical Study + Conceptual Framework).
3. **Strategic Type Selection:** A 6-step actionable decision protocol to apply at the point of paper framing, before writing begins.
